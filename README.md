# StaticBookLibrary
# This is a project on the problem statement 1 (V-Library)
In this project we have used HTML CSS and JQuery along with Bootstrap to create a static page that lets the user login and register and view all the subject pdfs and ppt uploaded by the admin.

Note: This is only a static page, so no backend is used in it.

To login into the application, 
  use the email: 
  # project1@gmail.com
  and password:
